# 🚖 ENSF 612 Project: NYC Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

## 📖 Overview

In the ENSF 612 project, our team embarked on an exciting journey to train machine learning models using **PySpark** (a Python API for Apache Spark). Our goal? To predict the total duration of taxi trips in the vibrant and complex environment of New York City (NYC). The dataset was meticulously chosen to shed light on the intricate traffic patterns of one of the world's busiest metropolises.

## 📓 Notebooks

Our approach is structured in 6 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks, located in the `./notebooks` directory:

1. `eda-data-cleaning.ipynb`: 🧹 Focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and preliminary data cleaning.
2. `clustering.ipynb`: 🌐 Dedicated to advanced feature engineering via clustering techniques.
3. `ml-linear-regression.ipynb`: 📈 Implementation of a Linear Regression model for prediction.
4. `ml-decision-tree.ipynb`: 🌳 Exploration of a Decision Tree model for insightful data splits.
5. `ml-rf.ipynb`: 🌲 Application of a Random Forest model for robust predictions.
6. `ml-gbm.ipynb`: 🔥 Utilizing a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model for improved accuracy.

**Important:** These notebooks are tailored for Google Colab. For seamless execution, ensure the drive path is correctly set to access the CSV files.

## 📊 Datasets

Corresponding datasets for each notebook are available in the `./dataset` directory:

- `train.csv`: 🚕 The primary training dataset.
- `train_cleaned.csv`: ✨ The refined, cleaned version of the training dataset.
- `train_cleaned_clustered.csv`: 🔍 The enhanced training dataset post-clustering process.
